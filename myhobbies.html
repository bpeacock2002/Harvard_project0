                            <div>Bike riding. My goal is to do a 100 mile ride some day.  My longest is 78 so far.</div>
                            <div>Cooking.  I learned a lot from my mother and did a lot when raising my sons. Still enjoy being in the kitchen.</div>
                            <div>Writing software.  I had my own development company in the 80s and we were green screen to start, then moved to VB and then VB.NET,  I now want to learn more web type things.</div>
                            <div>Reading.  Mostly historical novels, but especially Sherlock Holmes.  Can't believe Kareem Abdul Jabar is now writing Sherlock stories and doing such a great job, can't hardly tell the difference between him and Conandoyle.</div>
                            <div>Watching Opera.  I take my mpother to at least 2 operas every year because she enjoys them so much.</div>
                            <div>Playing Sudoku.  Don't know why, but I am hooled on it.</div>
                            <div>Crossword puzzles.  Pretty much the same addiction that I have to Sudoku.</div>
